# Phinity
Phinity is a synthetic data generation SDK designed to create high-quality, verifiable datasets for LLM development and evaluation.

# ðŸš€ What is Phinity?
Phinity builds upon Evol-Instruct, an instruction evolution method used by frontier AI labs to generate code SFT (supervised fine-tuning) datasets for LLMs. We extend this approach to support custom domain-specific dataset generation, ensuring high-quality data that aligns with your rules and context.

# ðŸŽ¯ Key Features
**Instruction Evolution Framework**
Phinity enables structured prompt evolution with multiple built-in strategies:

- Deepening â€“ Makes instructions more detailed and specific.
- Concretizing â€“ Adds concrete examples or scenarios.
- Reasoning â€“ Enhances reasoning or step-by-step explanations.
- Comparative â€“ Transforms prompts to include comparative elements.
ðŸ’¡ Users can add custom evolution strategies, define domain-specific constraints, and integrate supporting documents for more controlled instruction generation.

**Instruction Verification and Repair**
Phinity includes robust document verification to ensure evolved instructions remain answerable and relevant to provided sources.

**Instruction Repair Pipeline**
- Detects and corrects instructions that drift from document context (`_repair_instruction` and `_simplify_instruction`)

**Answerability Verification**
- Ensures instructions remain answerable using `_verify_answerability`
- Supports both strict and partial answerability checks.
  
**Document Relevance**
- Retrieves the most relevant sections of documents for each instruction.
- Uses vector similarity to fetch supporting context
- Supports integration with vector databases such as ChromaDB
**Domain-Aware Evolution**
- Incorporates domain context into the evolution process.
- Produces field-specific transformations to ensure data relevance.
- Supports multi-document grounding
