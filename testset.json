      "question": "What capabilities does Phinity offer for AI applications?",
      "answer": "Phinity is a comprehensive synthetic data generation platform designed for AI applications, helping create realistic test data for training and evaluating AI systems without using real user data. It specializes in generating question-answer pairs for RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) systems and can create various types of questions, including simple factual questions, complex multi-hop questions, and abstract questions that require synthesizing information from multiple sources. Phinity uses advanced natural language processing techniques to ensure the generated data is diverse and realistic and integrates with vector databases like ChromaDB to generate evaluation data directly from stored documents.",
